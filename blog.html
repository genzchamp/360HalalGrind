  <h1>How I Built My First Website Using ChatGPT (Step-by-Step)</h1>
  <p><em>By Nasiruddeen Abdulkarim (Oba) — Founder of 360HalalGrind</em></p>

  <p>In the name of Allah, the Most Merciful. I’m Nasiruddeen Abdulkarim, also known as <strong>Oba</strong>. I created <strong>360HalalGrind.com</strong> from scratch — with no money, no coding experience, and nothing but my Android phone, internet access, and ChatGPT as my teacher. Here’s how it all began.</p>

  <h2>Step 1 — The Vision</h2>
  <p>Every idea starts with intention. Mine was simple: to build a digital space that represents <strong>Halal Grind</strong> — Halal wealth, Halal work, and living only with the Permission of The Unique ONE.</p>
  <p>I wanted to share my journey, teach what I’m learning, and help others use technology in ways that please Allah. That’s how the name <strong>360 Halal Grind</strong> was born — a circle of faith, focus, and financial growth.</p>

  <h2>Step 2 — Discovering ChatGPT</h2>
  <p>I had no background in web development. But when I found ChatGPT, I realized I could learn and build at the same time. I started by asking simple questions like:</p>
  <pre><code>"ChatGPT, help me create my first website using only my Android phone."</code></pre>
  <p>That single prompt opened a new world for me. ChatGPT generated the first HTML and CSS code that became the foundation of my website.</p>

  <h2>Step 3 — Building With Free Tools</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>GitHub Pages:</strong> free hosting to publish my site.</li>
    <li><strong>Stackblitz:</strong> for editing code directly on my phone.</li>
    <li><strong>Canva:</strong> for creating my logo and banner designs.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These tools made it possible to go from zero to live site — completely free.</p>

  <h2>Step 4 — The First Launch</h2>
  <p>I copied ChatGPT’s code into a new GitHub repository, pushed my files, and activated GitHub Pages. When I visited my link and saw my site live, I couldn’t stop smiling — <em>Alhamdulillah</em>, it worked!</p>

  <h2>Step 5 — Expanding the Vision</h2>
  <p>After the first success, I started building multiple pages (Home, About, Blog, Contact). I wanted bold colors — <strong>gold, white, and neon ash on a dark rich background</strong> — representing faith and luxury through simplicity.</p>
  <p>Every time I got stuck, I returned to ChatGPT, learned something new, and improved the design. Slowly, it started looking professional — something I could truly call <em>mine</em>.</p>

  <h2>Step 6 — Lessons Learned</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You don’t need money to start — you need intention and effort.</li>
    <li>Technology can serve your faith and purpose if you use it right.</li>
    <li>ChatGPT is more than an AI — it’s a teacher if you learn to ask the right questions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Final Words</h2>
  <p>If you’ve ever felt stuck, remember — Allah already gave you the tools and time you need. Use what’s in your hands, stay sincere, and you’ll be amazed how far you can go.</p>
